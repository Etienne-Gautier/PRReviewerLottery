- How do I configure the pool of reviewers?

Once the extension is installed in your organization, go into each project's settings. In "Project Settings">Extensions>"PR Reviewer Lottery" you can configure your team of reviewers.

This integrates with the teams configured in "Project Settings">General>Teams


# Use
Assign a reviewer to your PR just by selecting `Assign Pull Request` from the `...` (3-dots) menu of your PR.
A reviewer will be picked from each of the groups configured in settings.
